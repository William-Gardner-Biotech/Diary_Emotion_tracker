Keep all of your Diaries stored in one safe and secure place. Simple Command Line Interface (CLI) with features centered around building comprehensive diary entries. Along with Diary support it will ask for your emotional rating levels of the four basic emotions (Fear Anger Sadness Happiness) and help you track your emotional level over time.

The idea of establishing and tracking emotional levels for this program comes from the Blade Runner universe. Specifically the Baseline test used in Blade Runner 2049 to judge an android's cognitive stability. While this program does not seek to distinguish humans from androids, it does hope to give the user more insights into their own mental health.

Features Include:
- Backdating
- User objects
- Reflection Intervals
- Prompting to gain more insight
- Emotion Graphs
- And many more to come!
