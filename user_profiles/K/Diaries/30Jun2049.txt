 I was sent on a mission to rural California to find a replicant named Sapper Morton. After some questioning, Sapper attacked me and we engaged in a brutal hand-to-hand combat. I managed to gain the upper hand and retrieved my gun. Sapper then uttered the words, "Never seen a miracle." I fired twice and retired him.

While sitting in my spinner, my droid alerted me to a crate buried beneath Sapper's tree. Upon investigation, I discovered a box containing the remains of a female replicant and a date that led me to believe she may have given birth. This discovery led me down a path of questioning my own identity and humanity.

As I continued my investigation, I encountered Luv at the Wallace Corporation's Earth Headquarters, where I requested information on the dead female replicant's serial number. After being shown an old memory fragment of Rick Deckard's Voight-Kampff testing, I began to question the nature of memories and their importance in defining one's identity.

That night, while dining outside of Bibi's Bar, I was approached by a prostitute named Mariette who attempted to retrieve information from me. Despite her efforts, I kept quiet and denied her sexual advances. My search for answers had only just begun.
