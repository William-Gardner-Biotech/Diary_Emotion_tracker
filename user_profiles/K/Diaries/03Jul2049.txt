I continued my investigation at LAPD Headquarters, feeling exhausted from the lack of electronic records due to the Blackout. I had to carry out the DNA analysis myself, with Joi joining me in the DNA analysis room. She showed me the wooden toy horse that was part of my childhood memory, which had the same date "6.10.21" carved on its base as Sapper's tree. It was a dangerous coincidence that opened the possibility of me being connected to the investigation. However, as a replicant, the truth could mean persecution and unwanted examinations.
