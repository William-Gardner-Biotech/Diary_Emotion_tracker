I intercepted a Wallace transport carrying Deckard, who was being taken to an off-world colony for torture and interrogation. I took out two escorting spinners and damaged the transport carrying Luv and Deckard, forcing it to land along the Sepulveda Sea Wall. I engaged in a brutal fight with Luv, eventually drowning her but not without being severely wounded myself. Despite my injuries, I managed to fake Deckard's death, claiming he drowned in the sea.
I then fulfilled my final mission: to take Deckard to meet his daughter at Stelline Laboratories. As Deckard entered the lab, I laid down on the steps outside and felt a sense of peace wash over me. I knew that my actions had led to something greater than myself and that Deckard and his daughter could now have a chance to build a life together. As I took my last breath, I was happy and fulfilled, knowing that I had played a part in their reunion.
