My search for the missing child had led me to the Wallace Corporation's Earth Headquarters. I requested information on the dead female replicant's serial number and provided a sample of DNA from a lock of hair found inside the ossuary. Inside Wallace's archives, an employee informed me that the serial number belonged to a pre-prohibition, standard issue, "unremarkable" replicant made by the Tyrell Corporation.

Just as I was leaving the archives, I was introduced to Luv, who would later lead me to a memory data-bank containing decades-old memories. She played a small audio memory fragment of former LAPD Officer Rick Deckard's Voight-Kampff testing of the unknown female replicant. It was a breakthrough in my investigation.

That night, I was dining outside of Bibi's Bar in Los Angeles when I was approached by a prostitute named Mariette. She tried to retrieve information from me, but I remained guarded and denied her sexual advances. I knew I had to keep my focus on the case, and that any distraction could be dangerous
