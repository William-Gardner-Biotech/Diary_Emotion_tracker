I returned to Sapper's protein farm to continue my investigation. While searching through Sapper's belongings, I found a cigarette tin containing an old baby sock and a photograph of a woman holding a baby in her arms, with Sapper's tree visible in the background. As I was leaving, I noticed that the date "6.10.21" was inscribed at the base of Sapper's tree. The discovery deeply disturbed me, and without much thought, I proceeded to set Sapper's farmhouse afire.
